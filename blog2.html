                    <p>TYPES OF INVESTORS</p>
                    <p><strong>Who are investors?</strong></p>
                    <p>An investor is an individual, corporation, or financial firm that invests its financial capital in a particular instrument, currency, or company in hopes of achieving similar financial returns in the future.

However, other investors tend to take additional risks to achieve greater returns. These investors can invest in currencies, emerging markets, or stocks. A distinction can be made between the terms "investor" and "trader".

For example, a scalp trader only holds a position for a few seconds.</p>
